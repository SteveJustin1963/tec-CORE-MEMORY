A hacker of the ancient creed,
Made better memoria volatilis from ferrite beads.
It soothed his old computatrum not groan,
With memory crafted, sharply honed,
A trick the ancients still decree!

Ferrite is a magnetic material made of iron oxide and other metals. It's used in many electronic devices, including computers, mobile phones, and hybrid electric vehicles. 
Properties
Ferrimagnetic: Attracted to magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets
Hard and brittle: A ceramic-like material that's usually gray or black 
Polycrystalline: Made up of many small crystals 
High resistivity: Has higher resistivity than a single metal or alloy magnetic material 
High dielectric properties: Has high dielectric properties 
High magnetic permeability: Has high magnetic permeability at high frequencies 
Uses
Ferrite is used in many electronic devices, including televisions, personal computers, mobile phones, and hybrid electric vehicles. 
Ferrite is used in high-frequency weak current applications. 
Ferrite is used in microwave circuitry. 
Examples of ferrite 
Magnetite (lodestone, or ferrous ferrite), Fe(Fe2O4)
Nickel ferrite, NiFe2O4
Manganese ferrite, MnFe2O4
YIG, Y3Fe5O12, a garnet mineral that contains the rare-earth element yttrium

A tinker with wires decreed,  
"My circuits need less EMI bleed!"  
With ferrite in tow,  
The noise had to go,  
Now signals are crispâ€”guaranteed!
